## OBJECTIVES

The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset of the crimes of the Montgomery County occurred in 2013 in order to answer some questions about the patterns of those data and also be able to pose our own questions (and the answer of those). In doing so, we are exercising the abilities of a Data Scientist, which is the main goal of this project.


## CONCLUSIONS

The notebook has the considerations and the conclusions about the questions made it in the project guide and also in the ones proposed by us. 
Apart from the project itself, the authors got impressed with the amount of information that is public in the US, even for specific states or counties. This approach make possible for any researcher to analyze the data provided, find some pattern and proposed actions in benefit of the society.

For example, with our analysis we can advise the residents of the zip code 20910 (the most dangerous region of our dataset) which streets they have less probability of been victim of crimes. We can also alert the population to be aware in the types of places that are occuring most of the violent crimes.
